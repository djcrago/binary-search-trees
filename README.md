In this project I:

- Created a binary search tree for the first time
- Developed methods to insert, remove, and find nodes with a given value, print out the level, pre, post, and in order structures of a tree, find the height or depth of a given node, determine if the tree is balanced and, if not, rebalance the tree
- I also developed a more succinct mergeSort algorithm than the one I wrote in the past
